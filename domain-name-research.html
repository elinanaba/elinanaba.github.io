        <dt>What is an internet domain name?</dt>
            <dd>A domain name is an address we enter in the address bar to access a site, consisting of several characters. Just as we have a street address at home, the website has an address that can identify. This refers in a broad sense to the hostname identifying the computer on the network, and in a narrow sense to the name registered in the domain registry.
                When we enter a domain name into a web browser, the browser connects to a domain name server (DNS) to find the location of the website that we've ordered to connect on the internet, so that the website can be brought back and shown to you. If there were no domain names, we would have to remember a specific IP address consisting of a lot of numbers to access the website. Domain names were invented to solve the problem.
                Domain names are expressed in order of Internet service, name, type of organization, and country. The last word in a domain name represents a top-level domain. For example, there’s the domain name such as www.kbook.co.kr. If you take a look at this domain name, you can see that “www” means Internet service, “kbook” means the name of the site, “co” means a company, and “kr” means South Korea. “Kr” is popular in Korea, but in general, the top-level domain called “com” is the most popular. Since there’s a rule for domain names, we can’t make them our own way. Nowadays, there’s a function called “auto-fill” which is used to help users write down domain names easily, even though they don't know full of domain names.</dd>
        <dt>Why are domain names so important on the web?</dt>
            <dd>First, by having a domain name, your site can look professional. In general, people do not fully trust the internet and online business. People will find it more difficult to trust sites that don't even spend money on buying domain names that match the names of the sites. Having a domain name can give people more credibility than sites that don't because it shows them that I spend money and time on the site.
                        Second, a domain name has an identity in itself and can raise awareness of your brand. This will further increase the value of your brand.
                        Third, a domain name can attract walk-in visitors. If you continue to produce quality content under your domain name, your website can be located at the top of the search engine. This will help to attract more users. Also, if you use words that are associated with your site for the domain name, It will give you an opportunity for people searching for words associated with it to stop by your site for a while.
                        Finally, having a domain name shows that you are thinking forward. It makes people expect you to build a site with the latest content and tech-knowledge.</dd>
        <dt>Why do domain names have to be unique?</dt>
            <dd>A unique domain name enhances brand awareness and market value. Also, it is easy to remember and promote in marketing.
                    Let's look at the domain name such as photobookstudio.com which is the domain name with a combination of common words. The name is too generic, so it makes it difficult to find distinctions from other similar sites. People can be confused with a similar site such as photostudio.com. People may enter misspellings of the domain name, as a result, you can forward people to the site that are in competition with your site even if you don't intend to. Moreover, these names are difficult to build on the value of your brands. However, creating an overly unique domain name is counterproductive. A domain name like xcwefsc.com is surely unique, but It's hard to remember it. Instead of a unique domain name consisting of an overly random combination of characters, new and unique words should be used for domain names while using existing words. The best example of that is Yahoo.</dd>
        <dt>What does it mean to "register (Links to an external site.)" a domain name?</dt>
            <dd>Registering a domain name means connecting the specific IP address that your site has with the domain name you created, so you don't have to enter IP addresses to access your site. People who are in on the other side of the world can easily get on your site by entering the domain name without remembering a series of numbers called IP.
                    Usually, the domain name is available for a certain period of time, If you want to continue using the domain, you must renew the registration before it expires. There is no way to use the domain name forever.
                    The registration of domain names applies to the principle of first com, first serve. There is a condition that trademark rights should not be infringed or illegal domain names should not be used, and that registrants (mainly NIC or InterNIC in their countries) are exempt from responsibility in the event of problems. Users get the address from Internet Service Providers called ISP, and ISP is assigned IP by regional, national, and continental Internet Registry; IR.</dd>
        <dt>If you wanted a domain name that is already taken, how could you get it?</dt>
            <dd>You can buy domain names from the domain name registrar who owns the domain. A domain name typically costs 14.99 per year. However, buying domain does not automatically give you hosting service. For that, you will need a website hosting account as well.</dd>
