        <h2>Search engines</h2>
        <dl id="top-dl">
          <dt>How does a search engine work?</dt>
          <dd>When we search something on a search engine like Google, it analyzes and outputs the result through its own algorithms. To provide the most useful information, the search algorithms look at various factors, such as the words of your query, relevence and usability of pages, expertise of sources, and your location or settings.<br>First, to show the relevant results for your query, the algorithm must first know what information you are looking for. Understanding the user's intentions is fundamentally understanding the language and this is extremely important in search. Search engines use language models to analyze this. This includes, for example, the spelling mistakes we often go through. Suppose you wanted to search for bananas, but you had butterfingers so that you entered bannana! Nevertheless, the analyzer will read your intentions and bring you bananas admirably.<br>The algorithm then analyzes the contents of the page to see if it contains information that may be relevant to what you want. For example, if you searched for a banana, it will check if the pages contain the same keyword as the banana, and determine that the page containing the keyword in the heading is highly relevant.<br>Next, the algorithm will look at the reliability of the source through a system that determines whether the site has expertise and authority on a given topic.<br>The accessibility of the page is also evaluated when ranking the results according to the search engine. There is a high probability that the site will be displayed correctly in different browsers and in various devices, including a smartphone or tablet.</dd>
          <dt>
            Why do different search-engines give different ranking to websites
            for the same search phrase?
          </dt>
          <dd>Because each search engine has different algorithms.<br>First, they deal with keywords differently. If you use targeted keywords on your website, your web will be ranked higher on Bing than Google. Because Google uses algorithms that can understand the context behind each search query, Bing still uses targeted keywords as ranking parameters.<br>Second, whether search engines include meta keywords is different. Bing considers meta keywords as an important ranking factor, but Google has stated that they do not.<br>Third, the way backlinks are handled is not the same. While Google considers the quality of the backlinks important, Bing looks at both the quantity and quality. If you have a lot of backlinks from a website in a less reliable domain, Google won't trust your website very much.<br>Fourth, it depends on the importance of social media. A good social media portfolio is advantageous in Bing but not significantly important at Google.<br>Finally, what content is used on the website is matters. The more text you write on a site, the more Google places it on top. Bing, on the other hand, also includes visual contents such as images and video data in its algorithms, so the more diverse the content it has, the better.</dd>
          <dt>What is a &lt;meta /&gt; tag?</dt>
          <dd>Meta tag is pieces of text that describes the contents of a page, which does not appear on the page itself but appears only in the source. It serves to tell the search engine what pages are about. The difference between metatag and other tags is the only location. Mata tags are located in HTML and are usually found in the head, so they can only be seen in the search engines. You can increase the traffic on your site by providing information about your page to search engines through meta tags.</dd>
          <dt>What is the purpose for Keyword and Description meta tags?</dt>
          <dd>The meta keyword is intended to represent the main keywords of the page, which are not visible to visitors but are visible to search engines. In the past, search engines used it as an important ranking factor, but as there are more spammers nowadays, they no longer consider it an important factor.<br>The meta description is designed to provide a brief summary of what is found on the web page. The description tag, compared with the title tag that is difficult to put a long explanation, can be a bit longer. This is exposed to a search engine and then can appeal to the users to click your website.</dd>
          <dt>Why might you include meta tags in your pages?</dt>
          <dd>I’ll use the meta tag because it can provide information to people. Using meta description tags on the website will help people figure out what my website is about. Since Google, which has the highest share of search engines, has a context-sensitive algorithm and does not include meta keyword tags in its rankings, I don't expect the meta tag to raise the ranking of the site. But there are also search engines that reflect keyword tags, so I will use all meta tags.</dd>
          <dt>
            Do meta tags make your pages more easily searchable or improve its
            ranking?
          </dt>
          <dd>I’ll use the meta tag because it can provide information to people. Using meta description tags on the website will help people figure out what my website is about. Since Google, which has the highest share of search engines, has a context-sensitive algorithm and does not include meta keyword tags in its rankings, I don't expect the meta tag to raise the ranking of the site. But there are also search engines that reflect keyword tags, so I will use all of the meta tags.</dd>
          <dt>
            What are several ways that you can publicize your personal website
            project and make it more visible on the web?
          </dt>
          <dd>First, fill every page of your site with rich content. Then, create a meta title tag and description tag for each page appropriately. Search engines will compare both tags with your actual pages and then reflect them in their results. If your site has quality content and a matching title, description tag, the site will be at the top of the search results. Optimizing images is also helpful. If images are saved in the appropriate format and have accurate alt tags and descriptions, they will be indexed and searched in the search engine's image search. Also, it is important to make it easier for people to share, such as putting social media icons. Recently, this benefit was confirmed as ranking factors in Google, so you should consider using it.</dd>
