            <h2 id="1">1. What is a web server? Why would you need one?</h2>
            <p>A server is a concept that contrasts with a client and it responds when a client requests it. The Web consists of a web browser and a web server. When we enter a URL in a web browser, a request for a webpage is delivered to the web server that corresponds to that URL. Web servers provide us with the information requested by web browsers.  Saving, processing, and delivering web pages to clients are the main features of the web server. It can also receive content from clients.
                <br>On the hardware side, a Web server is a computer that stores a website’s component files such as on HTML documents or images or CSS style sheets. These files are delivered to end-users' devices through the Internet. On the software side, a Web server basically manages how users access to host files.
            </p>
            <h2 id="2">2. Explain why getting a domain name is not enough to put your site up on the web.</h2>
            <p>Buying a domain name only gives you the right to use that specific name for a certain period of time. If you want to create a site with that name and show it to others, you have to save your files through web hosting. When you enter a domain name in your web browser, it first sends a request to a global network of servers that form the Domain Name System (DNS). These servers then look up for the name servers associated with the domain and forward the request to those name servers. In other words, If the domain name is the address of your website, web hosting can be said to the house where our website is located.
                <br>After you purchase hosting through a hosting company, you must link the domain name that you purchased so that you can see the site when you enter that domain name into the browser bar. We can buy both of them from different companies, or from the same company.
            </p>
            <h2 id="3">3. What service does a website hosting company provide?</h2>
            <p>A web hosting company makes it possible for your website to be accessed by everyone on the web. Web hosting is basically the space that you buy on a webserver to store your website files. When you buy website hosting you basically rent server space on a server where your web files will be placed. So whenever somebody will look up for your website by entering your domain, he will get directed to your website.
                <br>Web hosting companies specialize in storing and serving websites. They manage and maintain servers for you. If you set a server by yourself rather than through a hosting company, you will need a high-performance computer as well as a lot of RAM. In addition, you will need to have a high level of technical skills to manage and operate the server. The hosting company takes care of these things for you so that you don't have to prepare them.
            </p>
            <h2 id="4">4. What are the most important characteristics to look for in selecting a good web hosting company?</h2>
            <p>Choosing a Web hosting company is as important as choosing a business partner. There are many things you should consider: price, performance, services, etc.
                <br>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Price</dt>
                    <dd>Most hosting companies offer their basic services at reasonable prices. On average, a basic web hosting service costs around $10 a month. However, when you first sign a contract, you should read the contract carefully because the company offers the services at a low price with the promotion we first subscribe and then raises the price when the subscription needs to be renewed.</dd>
                    <dt>Performance</dt>
                    <dd>If you enter on a website and then the site is slow to load, you might want to get out of it. A slow-loading site will further increase the number of users leaving. The performance capability of web host is a very important consideration because customers have very low patience for slower loading websites.
                        <br>When comparing this, it is important to know what hardware the company uses. You should also consider what type of server you will use for your site. It is divided into types of shared, dedicated, or cloud-based.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Scalability</dt>
                    <dd>You should consider whether you can scale up or down as needed. If your site requires more traffic for a particular season, this feature will have to be considered.</dd>
                    <dt>Customer Support</dt>
                    <dd>Custom services are also an important factor in choosing a web hosting company. Does the company have a customer service that can be reached by chat or phone? What is the quality of the service?</dd>
                    <dt>Security</dt>
                    <dd>Are web hosting companies well equipped with the security technologies they need to prevent attacks such as DDoS? Does the company have the latest updates, patches, and protocols to ensure security?</dd>
                </dl>
            </p>
            <h2 id="5">5. Research companies that provide website hosting plans. On average, what is the price range for hosting a website?</h2>
            <p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Bluehost</dt>
                    <dd>It offers basic shared hosting from $2.95 monthly (on a three-year contract), with WordPress plans starting at $20 per month (although that’s also a discounted introductory rate).</dd>
                    <dt>InMotion</dt>
                    <dd>The plan includes the protection of malware or DDoS attacks, which are often charged extras from other companies. It starts at $3.99. </dd>
                    <dt>HostGator</dt>
                    <dd>The company has a plan for those people who are hunting for budget web hosting only $2.64. Even the basic plan is unrestricted in many respects. There are no limits on bandwidth or disk space, subdomains, MySQL databases, FTP and email accounts.</dd>
                    <dt>Hostinger</dt>
                    <dd>Its cheapest offer at the moment is a $0.80 (per month) web hosting package if you take a four year contract, great if you want to kickstart a small online venture but still limited because there’s no SSL or domain name bundled.</dd>
                </dl>
            </p>
            <p>I also searched other hosting companies such as GoDaddy, Tsohost, and Wix, and the average price of them was about $3.45 per month.</p>
            <h2 id="6">6. What are the most important features for you when reviewing a hosting plan?</h2>
            <p>I am not looking forward to a huge traffic on my site. So I compared all three hosting companies to the cheapest basic plan of shared hosting.</p>
