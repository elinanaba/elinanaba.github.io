        <dt>1. Website topic and title</dt>
                <dd>The topic is web deals. It is a site that collects discount information from online stores, mostly in North America.
                    <br>The title is “Dealmana”. “Deal” means deals such as hot deals, or good deals when we’re shopping. And the next, “mana” is a Korean word and it means “have a lot of”. I combined these words to express that there’s a lot of deals on our website!
                    <br>Because the main target audience is Korean and Korean-American, I named it by combining Korean words with the English word “Deal” to approach the Koreans in a familiar way.
                    <br>However, since the domain name that I want to buy can’t be purchased from the domain registrar company, I’m also thinking of “Dealmani” and “Deal2ya” as candidates. The meaning is similar to Dealmana.
                </dd>
        <dt>2. Target audience</dt>
                <dd>Koreans who are currently living in the U.S. or Canada</dd>
                <dd>Koreans who are not living in the U.S. but want to order at an online shop in the U.S.</dd>
                <dd>All those are interested in buying products at a lower price</dd>
                <dd>I’m considering the range of age from high school students to those in their 60s. So I will use simple, easy words and not have complex designs to attract people of various ages.</dd>
        <dt>3. Site purpose</dt>
                <dd>A site that collects promotion and coupon information from stores in the U.S. such as Amazon, Bestbuy, and Target. The site will provide useful information about the lowest prices or shopping tips.</dd>
            </ul>
        <dt>4. The URLs for three comparable site examples</dt>
                <dd><div class="siteName">Slickdeals (<a href="https://slickdeals.net/" target="_blank">https://slickdeals.net/</a>)</div>
                    <br><img src="images/screenshot2.jpg" alt="screenshot of Slickdeals" class="screenshot">
                    It is the largest deal-sharing community on the Web. There's a lot of deal postings every day, and there's a lot of users accessing them.</dd>
                <dd><div class="siteName">The Krazy Coupon Lady (<a href="https://thekrazycouponlady.com/" target="_blank">https://thekrazycouponlady.com/</a>)</div>
                    <br><img src="images/screenshot3.jpg" alt="screenshot of Krazy coupon lady" class="screenshot">
                    </dd>
                <dd><div class="siteName">CouponPX (<a href="https://www.couponpx.com/" target="_blank">https://www.couponpx.com/</a>)</div>
                    <br><img src="images/screenshot1.jpg" alt="screenshot of CouponPX" class="screenshot">
                    </dd>
        <dt>5. Main content you intend to include</dt>
            <dd>Deals</dd>
            <dd>Freebies</dd>
            <dd>Stores</dd>
            <dd>Community(Free-talks, Reviews)</dd>
        <dt>6. Site personality</dt>
            <dd>Informative;
                <br>Offers daily information on deals for users to buy things at a lower price
            </dd><br>
            <dd>Trendsetter;
                <br>The users can see which products are in trend now.
            </dd><br>
            <dd>Enjoyable;
                <br>Instead of just collecting discount information, I'll also focus on the feature of “community” so that the users are absorbed in the site.
            </dd>
        <dt>7. Limitations</dt>
            <dd>Since most of the sales information to be provided is from online stores, the main visitors will be users who are interested in buying things online. Such people are usually expected to have a fast Internet connection.
                <br>Due to the characteristics of users who want to check sales information frequently wherever they are, mobile chrome or Safari users will be expected as a high connection rate.
                <br>However, people will prefer to access their desktops when they purchase items that are expensive or want to check the color.
                <br>Therefore, it’s necessary to use a responsive design that is printed well in both devices.
