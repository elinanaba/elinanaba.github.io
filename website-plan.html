        <p>When I received the assignment about creating a personal website, the first thought I had in my head was “shopping”. Yes, I always search the way to buy an item online inexpensively. I've decided to use my interest to building a website.</p>

        <dt id="1">1. Website topic and title</dt>
                <dd>The topic is deals and sales on online shopping. It is the site that collects discount information from online stores, mostly in North America.
                    <br>The title is “Dealmana”. “Deal” means deals such as hot deals, or good deals when we’re shopping. And the next, “mana” is a Korean word and it means “have a lot of”. I combined these words to express that there’s a lot of deals on our website!
                    <br>Because the main target audience is Korean and Korean-American, I named it by combining Korean words with the English word “Deal” to approach the Koreans in a familiar way.
                    <br>However, since the domain name that I want to buy can’t be purchased from the domain registrar company, I’m also thinking of “Dealmani” and “Deal2ya” as candidates. The meaning is similar to Dealmana.
                </dd>
        <dt id="2">2. Target audience</dt>
                <dd>Koreans who are currently living in the U.S. or Canada</dd>
                <dd>Koreans who are not living in the U.S. but want to order at an online shop in the U.S.</dd>
                <dd>All those are interested in buying products at a lower price</dd>
                <dd>I’m considering the range of age from high school students to those in their 60s. So I will use simple, easy words and not have complex designs to attract people of various ages.</dd>
        <dt id="3">3. Site purpose</dt>
                <dd>A site that collects promotion and coupon information from stores in the U.S. such as Amazon, Bestbuy, and Target. The site will provide useful information about the lowest prices or shopping tips.</dd>
            </ul>
        <dt id="4">4. The URLs for three comparable site examples</dt>
                <dd><div class="siteName">Slickdeals (<a href="https://slickdeals.net/" target="_blank">https://slickdeals.net/</a>)</div>
                    <img src="images/screenshot2.jpg" alt="screenshot of Slickdeals" title="Main page of Slickdeals" class="screenshot">
                    It is the largest deal-sharing community on the Web. There's a lot of deal postings every day, and there's a lot of users accessing them.
                    <br>They made the navigation of deals according to the kind of items and stores so that it was easy to find deals that I wanted.
                    <br>One of notable feature is that the site has its own exclusive rebates. The lowest price people can't find on other sites is attracting users.
                    <br>Especially I like the color they used and the layouts. The use of gray and dark gray adds reliability to the site, and a neatly aligned layout makes users to see a many of products at a glance. One thing left to be desired is that there are too many components such as images, ads, and menu on the one screen. It would be better to reduce the number of components displayed in one column a little bit or place more spaces.</dd>
                <dd><div class="siteName">The Krazy Coupon Lady (<a href="https://thekrazycouponlady.com/" target="_blank">https://thekrazycouponlady.com/</a>)</div>
                    <img src="images/screenshot3.jpg" alt="screenshot of Krazy coupon lady" title="Main page of KCL" class="screenshot">
                    It's a site that shares deals similar to Slickdeals, but it feels more like a blog or a magazine. In addition to deals online, the site posts how to purchase items at an offline store at a lower price with a series of photos.
                    <br>As you can see from the screenshot of the main page, the site uses photos as a key component.</dd>
                <dd><div class="siteName">CouponPX (<a href="https://www.couponpx.com/" target="_blank">https://www.couponpx.com/</a>)</div>
                    <img src="images/screenshot1.jpg" alt="screenshot of CouponPX" title="Main page of CouponPX" class="screenshot">
                    It is a site with a similar purpose to the one I want to make. It is a site for Koreans living in the U.S. That's why they use Korean as their main language, and also made a forum for Koreans.
                    <br>It mainly posts online deals, with an average of six deals posted per day. This is less than the other two sites, so Koreans prefer Slickdeals than this site.
                    <br>It is made relatively narrower than Slickdeals and has a lot of white space. The products were displayed four in a row. I like the site more than the Slickdeals, which displays the items by five to six in a row, but I think it would be better to put more padding in the image of the product. The image and the border surrounding the image are so attached that it feels stuffy.</dd>
        <dt id="5">5. Main content you intend to include</dt>
            <dd><div class="FontsInDD">Deals</div>
                The page to post various information about sales from the online store. This is the space that is expected to have the highest pageview on the site. 
                <br>The products is displayed in a gallery style using flex-box like Slickdeals or CouponPX. Part of the products will be displayed on the main page.
                <br>The products are sorted out through detailed categories such as food, clothing, beauty, tech, and games.
            </dd>
            <dd><div class="FontsInDD">Coupons</div>
                The page on which I post coupon information for online and offline stores.</dd>
            <dd><div class="FontsInDD">Freebies</div>
                The page contains information about free samples.</dd>
            <dd><div class="FontsInDD">Community</div>
                It is a place where users can freely talk to each others. The users can talk about a wide range of topics from shopping reviews to memes.</dd>
        <dt id="6">6. Site personality</dt>
            <dd>Informative;
                <br>Offers daily information on deals for users to buy things at a lower price
            </dd><br>
            <dd>Trendsetter;
                <br>The users can see which products are in trend now.
            </dd><br>
            <dd>Enjoyable;
                <br>Instead of just collecting discount information, I'll also focus on the feature of “community” so that the users are absorbed in the site.
            </dd>
        <dt id="7">7. Limitations</dt>
            <dd>Since most of the sales information to be provided is from online stores, the main visitors will be users who are interested in buying things online. Such people are usually expected to have a fast Internet connection.
                <br>Due to the characteristics of users who want to check sales information frequently wherever they are, mobile chrome or Safari users will be expected as a high connection rate.
                <br>However, people will prefer to access their desktops when they purchase items that are expensive or want to check the color.
                <br>Therefore, it’s necessary to use a responsive design that is printed well in both devices.
