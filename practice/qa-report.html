        <h2>Research Questions</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>What does Quality Assurance mean for web site development?</dt>
            <dd>Quality Assurance (QA) guarantees that users get the best user experience and a stable user interface when using a mobile app or website. It is like a vaccine to prevent users from encountering inconveniences or flaws that might have been missed in the process of designing and developing by testing the site in various ways, whether the site is working well on any device or not. This usually involves testing requirements, evaluating designs, and testing functions.<br><br>Requirement testing takes into account the customer's requirements as well as other design documents approved by the customer. In this process, it should be evaluated that the layout of the site or the prototype version of the site meets the customer's requirements.<br><br>Design testing refers to looking at the appearance of the website. The design of the web app or website is checked whether their look and feel match the proposed design and the overall layout or not.<br><br>Functional testing is a process of ensuring that all of the functions on the website are properly executed as expected. It is the process of ensuring that the buttons or links on a website work well and that they operate properly without bugs in other browsers or devices.</dd>
            <dt>Describe the two key principles of Quality Assurance: "Fit for Purpose" and "Right First Time."</dt>
            <dd>“Fit for purpose” means that the product or service meets its intended purpose. And “right first time” is that any defect should be dealt with immediately.<br><br>With the two above principles in play, the goal is to ensure that the product or service works correctly all the time by controlling the project variables. To do so, quality assurance involves the management of the quality of raw materials, assemblies, products and components; services related to production; and the management, production and inspection process.</dd>
            <dt>How do web standard relate to web quality?</dt>
            <dd>Web standards are rules and guidelines established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed to promote consistency in the design code which makes up a web page. It simply refers to the mark-up language rule that defines how a web page is presented in the browser window of a visitor. There are several advantages to complying with these standards.<br><br>First, web pages will display in a wide variety of browsers and computers, including new technology like iPhones, Droids, iPads, PDA devices, mobile phones, which greatly increases the viewing audience. Second, W3C Standards promote the use of "Cascading Style Sheets" (CSS) or design code which is attached to the web page. rather than embedded in the page. The use of style sheets significantly reduces the page file size which means not only a faster page loading time but lower hosting costs for frequently visited sites due to using less bandwidth. Third, Design features such as colors and fonts can be easily changed by just modifying one style sheet instead of editing every individual page in a web site, reducing the costs to modify your site. Fourth, Search Engines are able to access and index pages designed to web standards with greater efficiency. Therefore, keeping standard will ultimately improve the quality of the website.</dd>
            <dt>Describe what Web Accessibility means. What steps you can take to make your pages more accessible?</dt>
            <dd>Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. It ensures that there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, generally all users have equal access to information and functionality. To achieve web accessibility, you can take the following steps:<dl>
                <dt class="small-dt">1. Understand what is accessibility</dt>
                <dd class="small-dd">Start by recognizing what accessibility is. Most people don't make it because they lack awareness, not because they oppose it. It is important to understand what accessibility is and what factors we should care about in order to make our website accessible.</dd>
                <dt class="small-dt">2. Build a document structure appropriately</dt>
                <dd class="small-dd">Headings, lists, and other structural elements provide meaning and structure to web pages. They can also facilitate keyboard navigation within the page.</dd>
                <dt class="small-dt">3. Use alternative text when inserting an image</dt>
                <dd class="small-dd">Alternative text provides a textual alternative to non-text content in web pages. It is especially helpful for people who are blind and rely on a screen reader to have the content of the website to read to them. When creating the alt text, the text should contain the message you want to convey through that image, and if the image includes text, that text should also be included in the alt.</dd>
                <dt class="small-dt">4. Use the right word in the link</dt>
                <dd class="small-dd">Every link should make sense if the link text is read by itself. Screen reader users may choose to read only the links on a web page. Certain phrases like "click here" and "more" must be avoided. Rather, it is better to use specific and distinct words.</dd>
                <dt class="small-dt">5. Use the color carefully</dt>
                <dd class="small-dd">People with disabilities who do not recognize a particular color or those with learning disabilities are affected by specific colors. Color must be used carefully to satisfy these people. A tool to evaluate colors will help you know if you have used colors correctly.</dd>
                <dt class="small-dt">6. Use the table for data</dt>
                <dd class="small-dd">Tables should be used to organize the data to suit its original purpose. In order to create a layout of website, use CSS instead of a table. The use of too many tables will bother people using screen readers. In addition, the table headers should be properly used in the table, and the headers should be able to describe their relationship with the cell.</dd>
                <dt class="small-dt">7. A website should be able to navigate with the keyboard</dt>
                <dd class="small-dd">A website should be made so that it can be explored only with a keyboard, taking into account those who are impaired in mobility or have been injured. Pages should be possible to distinguish sections by anchor links or to skip specific sections. Don't use hover css on the important elements. If you make important content visible only when a user hovers over it with a mouse, people using only the keyboard or users using a screen reader can't see the content.</dd>

        <h3>Review: City Chocolates by Chocolatiers</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Validation results for each of the site pages</dt>
            <dd>There were six errors and two warnings. The first warning was that the navigation role is unnecessary for element nav. The second warning was due to a lack of headings.<br>The errors that appeared three times was due to the button element that must not appear as a descendant of the a element. And the next error was due to bad value phone-number for attribute type on element input is a problem. Also, attribute “placeholder” is only allowed when the input type is specific such as email, number. Lastly, named character reference was not terminated by a semicolon.</dd>

            <dt>What was most helpful in establishing a clear purpose for the website that you reviewed?</dt>
            <dd>When I first entered this site, I saw delicious chocolate images both background and main page, so the purpose of this site is very clearly delivered. Shop menu, descriptions of chocolate products, products images, the shopping cart icon and the buy buttons helped me to figure out that the site is a store that sells chocolate.</dd>
            <dt>What was the thing that was most striking about the designs you saw?</dt>
            <dd>It was impressive that the site is even implemented detailed pages of each product from the store page. The "Buy" button was actually linked to the seller's social media account, which was impressive too.</dd>
            <dt>what would you like to change about your own team site based on your experience reviewing the other team's website</dt>
            <dd>The other teams' site had no broken links and all of the pages were well made. Unlike our website, both the design and the completion were high. I think it would be better to change the background. Using a fixed background image as the chocolatier team applied, will help us avoid the problems related arrangement we are having when put the contents below the navigation. In addition, it would be better to make contents that are to be placed at the bottom separately such as navigation. Also, I think using a space at the address of the website reduces visibility. The city chocolates had very neat address, on the contrary, our address has some %. I would suggest changing blank in our files to use dash or other things to avoid converting from blank to %.</dd>
