            <p>I bought this cute doughnut from the voodoo doughnut that one of the famous donut shop in Portland. Many people recommend the shop because it tastes so good! That's why the line is so long. I had to wait for almost 20 minutes. I really missed the donut, so I went there once more a month ago, and I was lucky on that day because I could buy it as soon as I got in! It was raining night on Monday, so few people were there! If you want to go there, I recommend visiting on a rainy night on weekdays.</p>
